Odin Project -- Landing Page

This is the second project that I am completing for the Odin Project. I have somewhat of a familiarity with landing pages as I currently work with them on the CRM side and wanting to convert leads after obtaining them.

The one thing that I am predicting will be the biggest challenge will be the use of flexbox.

I will overcome this challenge by constantly referring back on the learned material.
